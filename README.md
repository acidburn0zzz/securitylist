# securitylist

The securitylist repo is a superset of security advisories. It includes the NVD NIST database (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) which includes:

* The NVD data in JSON format
* Enrichment of the data (additional links, etc.)
* RESERVED CVE identifiers that are public from trusted sources but not yet in the NVD database ("STATE": "RESERVED")

Additional sources of security data that lack CVE identifiers or have incomplete coverage will also be added.
